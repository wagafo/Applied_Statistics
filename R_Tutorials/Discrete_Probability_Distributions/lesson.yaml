  Output: R has different functions to work with discrete probability
    distributions. There are also add-on packages that provide
    additional functions and features. We will review in this tutorial
    some of the functions available in base R and some other available
    in specialized packages.

  Output: A discrete probability distribution is just the distribution
    of values for a variable that can only take discrete values, that
    is, it is given by these values and their relative
    frequency. Imagine for instance that we have data the returns of
    an investment, and that the values can go from 8 thousands (8) to
    12 thousands (12), that is possible returns can be 8, 9, 10, 11 or
    12 thousands. Define a vector with these values and assign it to
    an object called "val".
  CorrectAnswer: c(8,9,10,11,12)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('val <- 8:12', 'val <- c(8,9,10,11,12)',
      val <- 'seq(8,12,1)'
  Hint: You have to define a vector that has the values 8, 9, 10,
      11, and 12, and assign it to "val", you can do it using
      different equivalent R expressions, such as "val <- c(8,9,10,11,12)",
      "val <- 8:12", or "val <- seq(8,12,1)".
